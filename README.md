#### About me

I am a software developer and product manager from Hungary. Currently, I work as a co-founder at dyrector.io. As a co-founder, my daily tasks fall somewhere on the scale between an engineering manager and a product manager. Based on my previous experiences, I have a more backend-oriented development background. I have worked on large enterprise systems where we used Java and the Spring Boot framework. After that, I started working more on the product side, managing multiple projects as a product manager who tries to bring the whole project together, working closely with developers and designers.

Due to my experiences, I have been able to contribute to both sides with actual work when needed. I have generally worked in smaller companies, so the roles were often blurred, and as a proactive person, I always approached tasks with the goal of solving them as quickly and as qualitatively as possible. Therefore, I have experience in many aspects and have seen a lot.

In recent years, I have also been close to cloud technologies, mainly handling cloud tasks in Azure for large English clients, but I am also familiar with AWS and GCP. I enjoy creating new things, solving problems, and working with people. This led me to identify myself more as an Engineering Manager today beside that I'm still love coding.

#### TLDR;

Regrettably, one aspect of my extensive experience throughout my career is that I consistently transitioned between various technology stacks. I worked for companies where deep knowledge wasn't crucial, but problem-solving ability was. This prevented me from gaining deep expertise. I consider myself a generalist, someone who has seen a lot, capable of examining and solving problems from multiple perspectives, even with the involvement of external help. I'm not afraid of new things; I love all aspects of IT, whether it's maintaining client relationships, solving people's problems, discussing and solving programming or infrastructure issues.
